* Sharkie is an all-in-one desktop application for those who are beginning to see the importance of tracking your money (looking at you, university students).
* Sharkie not only tracks your incomes and expenses - it also acts as a (friendly) loan shark to help you chase down money that your friends owe you.
* They may forget their debts, but Sharkie never will 💰🦈
