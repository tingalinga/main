== Introduction

Welcome to TeaPet!

image::Ui.png[width="790"]

TeaPet is an integrated platform fully customized for Primary School Form Teachers to help you manage your classroom effectively.
It contains your personal curriculum schedule, students' particulars, and can also track your class' academic progress.

All your important information is comfortably compartmentalized on our simple and clean Graphical User Interface (GUI) and we are optimized for users who are very comfortable
working on the Command Line Interface (CLI).

If you are looking for a way to easily manage your administrative classroom chores
and have quick hands, then TeaPet is definitely for you!

== About
The aim of this Developer Guide is to provide an introduction to the software architecture and implementation of TeaPet.
It is made for developers who wish to understand and maintain the backbone of our application.

At TeaPet, we prioritise teamwork. We welcome you developers to contribute and improve on our application anytime by
opening an issue should you have any refreshing ideas to improve TeaPet after reading this guide.

== How To Use
This section will teach you how should you go about understanding our Developer Guide in order to best understand our product.

Reading ahead, you will find that we've adopted the "top-down" approach into the structure of our Developer Guide --
We will first look at the high-level architecture of our application before delving into the implementation details of each feature that makes up TeaPet.

We encourage you to read every page diligently from the top to the bottom in order to get the highest level of understanding of our application.
If you are only interested in how we develop one feature, you may read the high-level design then focus on the implementation of that particular feature.

== Setting up
This section provides you with the tools needed for you to set up TeaPet.

You can refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

This section describes the high-level design details of TeaPet.

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture
This section describes the high-level software architecture of TeaPet.

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component

[discrete]
==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component
This section describes the high-level software structure of TeaPet's UI Component.

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StudentListPanel`, `NotesPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component
This section describes the high-level software structure of TeaPet's Logic Component.

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a student).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`,and then displayed to the user.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help (for commands) and toggling of view between `default`, `detailed` and `admin`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

This section describes the high-level software structure of TeaPet's Model Component.

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* stores the Notes data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Student>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.



[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component
This section describes the high-level software structure of TeaPet's Storage Component.

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* converts Model objects into savable data in JSON-format and vice versa.
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can store `Student`, `Academics` and `PersonalSchedule` data in a single json file, which can be read.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Class particulars feature
The class particulars feature keeps track of essential student details.
The feature comprises of four commands namely,

* `AddCommand` - Adds the student particulars into the class list
* `EditCommand` - Edits the particulars of a student
* `DeleteCommand` - Deletes the student information
* `FindCommand` - Finds information of the required student

The commands when executed, will interface with the methods exposed by the `Model` interface to perform the related operations
(See <<Design-Logic,logic component>> for the general overview).

.Class Diagram for Commands
image::CommandClassDiagram.png[]

[[Feature-Add]]
==== Add command

===== Implementation

The following is a detailed explanation of the operations which `AddCommand` performs.

*Step 1*. The `AddCommand#execute(Model model)` method is executed which takes in a necessary student name and additional attributes.
[NOTE]
Format for adding NOK details is `add n/<NAME> nok/<NAME-RELATIONSHIP-CONTACT>`.

*Step 2*. The student is then searched through the `UniqueStudentList#students` list using the
 `Model#hasStudent(Student student)` method to check if the student already exists. If the student exists, the `CommandException` will be thrown
with the duplicate students error message.

*Step 3*. The method `Model#addStudent(Student student)` will then be called to add the student. The command box will be reflected with
the `AddCommand#MESSAGE_SUCCESS` constant and a new `CommandResult` will be returned with the message.
[NOTE]
If the format or wording of adding a student contains error(s), the behaviour of TeaPet will be similar to step 2, where either a unknown command
or wrong format error message will be displayed.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add operation works:

image::AddSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Edit command

===== Implementation

The following is a detailed explanation of the operations which `EditCommand` performs.

*Step 1*. The `EditCommand#execute(Model model)` method is executed which edit attributes of the selected student. The method
checks if the `index` defined when instantiating `EditCommand(Index index, EditStudentDescriptor editStudentDescriptor)` is
valid. Since it is optional for users to input fields, the fields not entered will reuse the existing values that are currently stored and defined
in the `Student` object.

*Step 2*. A new `Student` with the updated values is created and it is then searched  through the `UniqueStudentList#students` list using the
 `Model#hasStudent(Student student)` method to check if the student already exists. If the student exists, the `CommandException` will be thrown
with the duplicate students error message.

*Step 3*. The newly created `Student` will replace the old one through the `Model#setStudent(Student oldStudent, Student editedStudent`
method.

*Step 4*. The command box will be reflected with the `EditCommand#MESSAGE_SUCCESS` constant and a new `CommandResult` will be returned with the message.

=== Import image feature
=== Personal Schedule feature
==== Command 1
==== Command 2
=== [Proposed] Undo/Redo feature
==== Proposed Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th student in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new student. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the student was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous address book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone address book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoState5.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the student being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.

=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

_{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Logging
This section describes how TeaPet record it's logs.

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
